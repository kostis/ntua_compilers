$$
  In this erroneous grace program a variable with type integer will be used as
  an array.

  Variable 'myArray' has been declared as an integer, but it is used as an array
  of integers.

fun main() : nothing
  var i, initialVal : int;
  var myArray : int;

{ $ main
  writeString("Give initial value: ");
  initialVal <- readInteger();
  i <- 0;
  while i < 10 do
    myArray[i] <- initialVal;
  writeString("Array was initialized successfully!\n");
} $ main

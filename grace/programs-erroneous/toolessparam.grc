$$
  In this erroneous grace program a function is called with less arguments than
  expected.

  Function 'median' takes two integer parameters, but when called it is given
  only one argument.
$$

fun main() : nothing
  var result : int;

  fun median(a, b : int) : int {
    return (a + b) div 2;
  }

{ $ main
  writeString("The median of one number exists and it is ");
  result <- median(4);
  writeInteger(result);
  writeString(".\n");
} $ main

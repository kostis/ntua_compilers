$$
  In this erroneous grace program a function is used as a variable.
  An assignment statement has the name of the function as an l-value.

  Function 'storage' is used as an l-value in the block of the 'main' function.
$$

fun main() : nothing
  var n : int;

  fun storage() : nothing {
    writeString("To be honest, I can\'t store any value...\n");
  }

{ $ main
  n <- 4;
  storage <- n;
  writeString("Hopefully this got stored...\n");
}

$$
  In this erroneous grace program an assignment to a type of array happens.

  Variable 'str' is an array of characters and it is tried to assign a string to
  it.
$$

fun main () : nothing
  var str : char[20];

{ $ main
  str <- "Hello world!\n";
  $ This should be done like this:
  $ strcpy(str, "Hello world!\n");

  writeString(str);

  return;
}

$ Same test as scope/nested_functions_3.grc but with same signature -> Requires runtime to see the expected result

fun main(): nothing
    fun f(): nothing
        
        fun g(): nothing
        { $ g
            $ This should call outer f because inner f is not yet declared/defined
            $ even though it is on the same level as g
            $ So when g is looking for f, it finds the outer f
            $ Note: the different signature is used so the test can work without needing a runtime env
            $ Note: We are expecting a same test in runtime to have the same result
            f();
        } $ g

        fun f(): nothing
        { $ f
            writeString("Inner f");
        } $ f
    
    { $ f
        writeString("Outer f");
        g();
    } $ f

{ $ main
    $ This calls outer f
    $ outer f -> g -> inner f
    f();
} $ main

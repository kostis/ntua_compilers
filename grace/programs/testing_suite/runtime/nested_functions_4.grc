$ Same test as scope/nested_functions_4.grc but with same signature -> Requires runtime to see the expected result

fun main(): nothing
    fun f(): nothing
        $ Forward declare inner f
        fun f():nothing;
        
        fun g(): nothing
        { $ g
            $ This should call inner f because of the forward declaration
            $ Inner f is expecting no params, so this should fail in semantic analysis
            f();
        } $ g

        fun f(): nothing
        { $ f
            writeString("Inner f");
        } $ f
    
    { $ f
        writeString("Outer f");
        g();
    } $ f

{ $ main
    $ This calls outer f
    $ outer f -> g -> inner f
    f();
} $ main

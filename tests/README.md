The PROGRAM_test.py is for testing that the corresponding PROGRAM works as it should.

Usage: ./PROGRAM_test.py [filename of program to test]

The examples/PROGRAM.py are example implementations for each test. They were written as part of Alan testing suite (in order to make sure that the Alan implementations were performing as should - when they compiler was still unavailable) but moved here in order to make clear what each test expects.
